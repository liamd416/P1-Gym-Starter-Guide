# Gym Starter Guide

One of the hardest things about trying to get in shape is not knowing where to start. We want to change that. Gym Starter Guide is a responsive website that will show you exactly where to begin and how to target each muscle group. We have a great layout of different workouts avaliable and the muscles they train. Whilst this site is designed for demostration, it is very close to my heart. I hope that the information helps others as it has me.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- A future feature I would like to add is a nutrition page to describe how to calculate macros and ensure you are following a safe diet with the right amount of calories.

## Testing 

- Tested the scaling of the website using developer tools and the emulator screen sizes. All device screens scale properly but when customer dragging the windows, the icons on the home page can become oval shaped.

Some screens also cause footer to have a whitespace underneath, hiding overflow does not resolve. Changing background to match footer color as a temporary fix. Was unable to fix bug by time of submission

-Testing scaling on all screens for the workout page. No faults found

-Testing Contact us page. Validation works. Redirect works. No Faults found

-Hovering over workout images scale them up as designed. No faults found

-Initially had an image of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the background for contact form but was unable to scale correctly. Changed to linear gradient color effect instead.
