# Gym Starter Guide

One of the hardest things about trying to get in shape is not knowing where to start. We want to change that. Gym Starter Guide is a responsive website that will show you exactly where to begin and how to target each muscle group. We have a great layout of different workouts avaliable and the muscles they train. Whilst this site is designed for demostration, it is very close to my heart. I hope that the information helps others as it has me.

## Features 

We have many features I know that are going to love about the Gym Starter Guide!

### Existing Features

- __Home Page__

  - The Home page will be the first thing you see. It includes a great black and white of image of Frank Zane and his incredible physique. This is to attract customers who aspire to get in shape and draw their attention to the possibilities. Adjacent to the image is a section explaining what the website to do Along with some simple icons relevant to the section.

 - The Footer section gives customers a way to access the social media links of the business. This includes a Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram link. 

- __The Workouts page__

The workouts page displays circular images of each body type in a column view above the table with the workouts they are for. When hovering over the icons, they will scale up slighlty, making aethesitcally pleasing when finding the workouts you are looking for.

The tables are under the corresponding images for each workout. Contrasting colours

### Features Left to Implement

- A future feature I would like to add is a nutrition page to describe how to calculate macros and ensure you are following a safe diet with the right amount of calories.

## Testing 

- Tested the scaling of the website using developer tools and the emulator screen sizes. All device screens scale properly but when customer dragging the windows, the icons on the home page can become oval shaped.


- Testing scaling on all screens for the workout page. No faults found

- Testing Contact us page. Validation works. Redirect works. No Faults found

- Hovering over workout images scale them up as designed. No faults found

- Initially had an image of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the background for contact form but was unable to scale correctly. Changed to linear gradient color effect instead.

  ### Unfixed Bugs

  - Some screens also cause footer to have a whitespace underneath, hiding overflow does not resolve. Changing background to match footer color as a temporary fix. Was unable to fix bug by time of submission.
